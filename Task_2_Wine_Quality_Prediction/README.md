# 🍷 Task 2: Wine Quality Prediction

This is Task 2 of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (July 2025)**.  
We used machine learning to predict the quality of red wine based on physicochemical properties.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI ML Repository
- Features: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, pH, alcohol, etc.
- Target: Quality (scale of 0–10)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)

## ✅ Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## 🧠 Best Model
Random Forest gave the highest accuracy among all models tested.
